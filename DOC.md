## PART A: Technical Report

### A1. Identifying & Defining

#### Problem Statement
Basketball enthusiasts and analysts need an efficient system to access comprehensive player statistics and game simulation tools. The current process of gathering player data and predicting game outcomes is time-consuming and lacks integration. This project develops an NBA Player Stat Viewer & Simulator to address these needs.

#### Feasibility
- **Technical**: Python with Flask framework provides robust web development capabilities
- **Economic**: Open-source technologies minimize licensing costs
- **Operational**: Web-based access ensures platform independence
- **Time**: 10-week development timeline is feasible for MVP delivery

#### Functional Requirements
1. User authentication and authorization
2. Player statistics viewing and comparison
3. Team and player matchup simulation
4. Historical game data analysis
5. Responsive web interface
6. Real-time data updates

#### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: <2s response time for all operations
2. **Security**: Secure authentication, input validation, and API key protection
3. **Usability**: Intuitive interface with responsive design
4. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for production environment
5. **Scalability**: Support for up to 1000 concurrent users

#### Data Structures
- **Players Table**: player_id (PK), name, team, position, stats
- **Teams Table**: team_id (PK), name, conference, division, stats
- **Games Table**: game_id (PK), home_team_id (FK), away_team_id (FK), date, score
- **User Favorites**: user_id (FK), player_id (FK), team_id (FK)
- **Simulation Results**: simulation_id (PK), parameters, result, timestamp

#### System Boundaries
- **In Scope**: Player/team statistics, game simulation, user accounts, responsive UI
- **Out of Scope**: Live game streaming, mobile app development, betting features

### A2. Research & Planning

#### Planning Method: Agile with Scrum
**Justification**:
- Iterative development allows for regular feedback
- Adaptable to changing NBA season dynamics
- Regular sprints ensure continuous progress
- Daily standups and sprint reviews maintain project momentum

#### Stakeholder Management
- **Stakeholders**: Basketball fans, analysts, fantasy sports players
- **Feedback Mechanisms**:
  - Bi-weekly demos with test users
  - Online feedback forms
  - User acceptance testing sessions

#### Scope Control
- **Change Management Process**:
  1. Submit change request
  2. Impact analysis
  3. Approval/rejection
  4. Implementation planning
  5. Testing and deployment

### A3. Testing & Evaluating

#### Security Measures
1. **Authentication**: JWT token-based authentication
2. **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
3. **API Security**: Rate limiting and API key rotation
4. **CSRF Protection**: Flask-WTF forms with CSRF tokens
5. **Data Protection**: Secure storage of API keys and user data

#### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**: Pytest for individual components
2. **Integration Testing**: Test API integrations
3. **Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning
4. **User Acceptance Testing**: Real users validate functionality
5. **Performance Testing**: Locust for load testing API endpoints
